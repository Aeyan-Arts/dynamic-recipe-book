        Bee Movie <br>
        By Jerry Seinfeld <br>

        NARRATOR: <br>
        (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
        According to all known laws
        of aviation,:
        there is no way a bee
        should be able to fly.
        :Its wings are too small to get
        its fat little body off the ground.
        :The bee, of course, flies anyway
        :because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible.
        BARRY BENSON:
        (Barry is picking out a shirt)
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
        :Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
JANET BENSON:
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
BARRY:
Coming!
 :
Hang on a second.
(Barry uses his antenna like a phone)
 :
Hello?
ADAM FLAYMAN:

(Through phone)
- Barry?
BARRY:

ADAM:
- Can you believe this is happening?
BARRY:
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
(Barry flies down the stairs)

Looking sharp.
JANET:
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
BARRY:
Sorry. I'm excited.
MARTIN:
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
 :
A perfect report card, all B's.
JANET:
Very proud.
(Rubs Barry's hair)
BARRY=
Ma! I got a thing going here.
JANET:

BARRY:
- Ow! That's me!

JANET:
